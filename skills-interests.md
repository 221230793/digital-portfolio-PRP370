## ðŸ’¬ Reflection (STAR Technique)

**Situation:** I needed to understand where my strengths lie as an ICT student and how I can contribute to a real-world team.  
**Task:** Evaluate my current skills and match them with internship or WIL opportunities.  
**Action:** I completed a university-provided skills audit and reflected on previous project experience.  
**Result:** I found that I have strong skills in HTML, CSS, Java, and PHP (Laravel), along with good communication and adaptability. I am particularly interested in front-end development and mobile apps.
